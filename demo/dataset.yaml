# dataset.yaml - system dataset config file

# dataset_type: string
#    the dataset class to use to load the dataset
dataset_type: image

# params: additional information about the dataset required to load or transform its items
params:
  # data_dir: string
  #     the path to the folder in which the dataset is stored
  #     can be a relative or an absolute path
  data_dir: '.\demo\sample_mnist_dataset'
  # image_format: string
  #    the file extension of the images in the dataset
  #    only accepts a single value
  image_format: '.png'
# preprocessed: bool
#     whether to use a preprocessing stack to transform the dataset and cache results
#     if set to True, you must also define the preprocessed_stack key and contents below
preprocessed: True
# preprocessed_stack: defines the preprocessing stack and transforms to use with the dataset
#     only used when preprocessed is True
#     contains a transform_list with a list of transform classes to apply
#     formatting is the same as in preprocessing.yaml
preprocessed_stack:
  # transform_list: the transforms to use in the preprocessing stack
  #     one entry per transform; general format:
  #     name: the system or PyTorch transform class to use
  #     params: if required by the specific transform, additional configuration parameters
  # WARNING: Any transforms placed in this list will only be applied once the first time
  # an item is loaded, and the cached result will be returned for further requests.
  # If you need a transform to be randomized per-experiment it should go in preprocessing.yaml.
  # Stochastic transforms in this list will only be applied once across ALL runs in an experiment. 
  # If you are using random transforms for data augmentation this WILL NOT achieve the intended result.
  # this list otherwise works exactly like the one in preprocessing.yaml; see there for example configuration
